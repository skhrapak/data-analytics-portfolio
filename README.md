## About

As a researcher with over 25 years of experience in theoretical physics -- including plasma
physics, condensed matter and physics of fluids -- I have a strong background in complex
data analysis, mathematical modeling, and problem-solving. Throughout my career, I have
worked extensively with large and complex datasets, identifying patterns, correlations, and
trends, as well as developing models and theories to drive scientific discoveries.

My recent involvement in data analytics has expanded my skill set to include Python, Power
BI, Tableau, SQL, and statistical analysis. My expertise in handling datasets of varying sizes
and complexities, combined with my strong analytical mindset, enables me to transform raw
data into meaningful insights that support informed decision-making.

I am excited to apply my scientific approach and technical expertise to real-world business
challenges, leveraging data to optimize processes, improve efficiency, and drive strategic
success.
